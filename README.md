# SOSS â€” SafeOnionStreamServer

**SOSS** (SafeOnionStreamServer) is a streaming provider project focused on **anime, movies and series**.  
Our goal is to offer a modern, well-organized backend ready to serve content with security, reliability and simplicity.

## What it is
SOSS is the provider: it delivers content (video and metadata) and handles the backend infrastructure necessary for apps and frontends to consume movies, series and anime in a consistent and scalable way.

## Main ideas
- **Simplicity**: clear architecture and easy-to-understand code.  
- **Reliability**: focus on stability and recovery.  
- **Responsible privacy**: concern for user data and minimal retention practices.  
- **Maintainability**: designed to be easy to operate and evolve.

## Who it's for
- Backend teams that need a solid provider for video content.  
- Developers who want to learn from an organized project ready to scale.  
- Partners who need a reliable endpoint to deliver series, movies and anime.

## What you'll find here
- Backend structure (content, catalog and streaming APIs).  
- Routes and basic examples for integration with frontends and other servers.  
- Minimal documentation to get started (installation, local run and deploy).

> [!WARNING]
> Note: this repository covers the **provider** (backend). Integration with players, apps and clients is the responsibility of the frontend or another server.
